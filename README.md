# Azure IaC & Policy as Code (Bicep)

This repository contains my personal learning projects for **Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **Policy as Code (PaC)** using **Bicep**.

It includes hands-on work as I learn to design, deploy, and govern Azure resources through code.

## Folder Overview

- **Infrastructure as Code/** – My projects and templates for provisioning Azure resources such as virtual networks, storage accounts, and virtual machines.  
- **Policy as Code/** – Policy-as-Code projects, including custom Azure Policy definitions and initiatives for governance and compliance.  

## Notes

This repo is for continuous learning and experimentation with Azure. Expect simple templates at first and ongoing updates as I explore more advanced, real-world scenarios.
